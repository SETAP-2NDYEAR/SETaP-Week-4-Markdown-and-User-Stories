1. "How would you prefer to be notified when a prescription is available?" - Generate a text message to send to the patient, if 30 days past after a monthlong subscription the patient should be able to go to the app and ask the gp to generate their perscription. The app should have the ability to request urgent medication straight to the nhs emergency services instead of the gp in order to generate the perscription as an emergency perscription. Can only generate two emergency perscriptions per year.
2. "Would there be a seprate system to allow for a carer to control multiple patients prescriptions" - Cares have to be assigned to a patient so they cant get a hold of unnecessary prescriptions. Separate interface for carers. Parents can be assigned to anyone under 18. Cares can take on multiple patients at once
